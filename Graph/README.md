# Graph Implementation using adjacency list representation.

      Adjacency list representation of a graph with basic functionalities, implemented in C language.
      All the basic functionalities of a graph are included in the same source code which was the main objective of the project

## Functionalities
      
      1. Create a Graph 
      2. Display the Graph 
      3. Add New Vertex 
      4. Add New Edge 
      5. Delete Vertex 
      6. Delete Edge 
      7. Depth First Traversal 
      8. Breadth First Traversal

## Setup and Installation

	->Download the 'Graph' folder.
	->Compile the 'Graph.c' file using any standard C compiler.
	->Run the Executable file and the program will run on the CMD.

## Instructions to use

	-> Enter the number of Vertices
	      Vertices will be creted starting from 1 to the number given.	
      -> Create all the Edges which are Connecting the vertices      
		If there's an Edge from 2-->3		
            input: 2 3 		
            To end input: 0 0	
      -> After the Graph is created successfully select the option number to execute the required function.      

## Support
      
      Can run on any platform which has a standard C compiler
